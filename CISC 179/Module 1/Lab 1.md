# Lab 1: Introduction to Python

## Question 1
Create a two-column table; the first column stores the number of languages, and the second column stores the type of language (compiled, interpreted, or both).

## Question 2
Discuss the real-world example where Python performance is superior to compiled languages such as C++. To answer this question, you need to do some research.

Python is superior to C++ in a lot of different ways, but I found that it is highly influential in scientific computing. Since it is user friendly, intergrates seamlessly with scientific tools, and contains extensive libraries, it remains highly accessible to researchers in this field. Some specific linraries and frameworks that make Python so good for scientific computing are NumPy, SciPy, and Panda. It can also intergrate with other languages, such as C++, to take existing tools and incprorate Python's ease of use.
